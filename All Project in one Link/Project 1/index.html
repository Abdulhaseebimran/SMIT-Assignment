                <h2>Missile Man of Pakistan</h2>
                <p> <b>Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan</b> for his valuable services to make the country invincible.
                    Posthumous “The Sir Syed Ahmed Khan Peace Award” was presented to him in a grand ceremony held by Aligarh Muslim University Old Boys’ Association (AMUOBA) and Sir Syed University of Engineering & Technology (SSUET) jointly at a local hotel. Mr. Khan’s daughter Dr. Dina Khan received the award.In the ceremony, a gold medal was also given to Lady Hendrina Khan, wife of Dr. Qadeer Khan, which was also received by their daughter Dr. Dina. On the occasion, a souvenir book “The Sir Syed Ahmed Khan Peace Award presented to Dr. A.Q. Khan”, featuring Dr. Khan’s family and his social services was also launched. Dr. Dina Khan, daughter of Dr. AQ Khan, said, “I will continue the mission of my father who was involved in so many projects. If I did at least one, it means I lived a life that has not gone to waste. We need to work together for the development of the country and nation, paying no attention to differences. Education is the primary thing required for growth as a nation and country. My father wanted to do many things but he was not allowed to do it. His knowledge and skill were wasted. She underscored that my father appointed me the chairperson of AQ Hospital of AQ Foundation, which is a family foundation, but the hospital has been high-jacked. There is a misappropriation of funds in the name of Dr. AQ Khan at the hospital.</p>
